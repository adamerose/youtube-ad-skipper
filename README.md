# About

I made ad skipper this because of YouTube's new policy of disabling video playback if you have an ad blocker enabled. This doesn't block ads it just skips them.

## Features

- Automatically click the Skip Ad button as soon as possible
- Mute videos during ads then unmute after

# Run Locally

```
# INITIAL SETUP
# Build the extension
zip -r youtube-ad-skipper.zip youtube-ad-skipper/

# Go to chrome://extensions/ -> Click Load Unpacked -> Select this project as folder

# UPDATING
# git pull
```
